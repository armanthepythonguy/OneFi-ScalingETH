/// SerialSubmitter accepts undelivered messages over a channel from a
/// MessageProcessor. It is responsible for executing the right strategy to
/// deliver those messages to the destination chain. It is designed to be used
/// in a scenario allowing only one simultaneously in-flight submission, a
/// consequence imposed by strictly ordered nonces at the target chain combined
/// with a hesitancy to speculatively batch > 1 messages with a sequence of
/// nonces, which entails harder to manage error recovery, could lead to head of
/// line blocking, etc.
///
/// The single transaction execution slot is (likely) a bottlenecked resource
/// under steady state traffic, so the SerialSubmitter implemented in this file
/// carefully schedules work items (pending messages) onto the constrained
/// resource (transaction execution slot) according to a policy that
/// incorporates both user-visible metrics (like distribution of message
/// delivery latency and delivery order), as well as message delivery
/// eligibility (e.g. due to (non-)existence of source chain gas payments).
///
/// Messages which failed delivery due to a retriable error are also retained
/// within the SerialSubmitter, and will eventually be retried according to our
/// prioritization rule.
///
/// Finally, the SerialSubmitter ensures that message delivery is robust to
/// destination chain reorgs prior to committing delivery status to
/// HyperlaneDB.
///
///
/// Objectives
/// ----------
///
/// A few primary objectives determine the structure of this scheduler:
///
/// 1. Progress for well-behaved applications should not be inhibited by
/// delivery of messages for which we have evidence of possible issues
/// (i.e., that we have already tried and failed to deliver them, and have
/// retained them for retry). So we should attempt delivery of fresh
/// messages (num_retries=0) before ones that have been failing for a
/// while (num_retries>0)
///
/// 2. Messages should be delivered in-order, i.e. if msg_a was sent on source
/// chain prior to msg_b, and they're both destined for the same destination
/// chain and are otherwise eligible, we should try to deliver msg_a before
/// msg_b, all else equal. This is because we expect applications may prefer
/// this even if they do not strictly rely on it for correctness.
///
/// 3. Be [work-conserving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-conserving_scheduler) w.r.t.
/// the single execution slot, i.e. so long as there is at least one message
/// eligible for submission, we should be working on it within reason. This
/// must be balanced with the cost of making RPCs that will almost certainly
/// fail and potentially block new messages from being sent immediately.
///
/// TODO: Do we also want to await finality_blocks on source chain before
///  attempting submission? Does this already happen?
